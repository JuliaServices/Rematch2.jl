Pattern matching.  A rewrite of [`Rematch.jl`](https://github.com/RelationalAI-oss/Rematch.jl)
that offers improved performance at runtime.

`Rematch2.jl` provides a syntax sugar for matching julia values against syntactic
patterns. The `@match` macro expands a pattern-matching syntax into a series of
if-elses that check the types and structure of the provided value, allowing you
to more simply write checks that describe your intent.

``` julia
julia> using Rematch2

julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> f(x) = @match x begin
           _::String => :string
           [a,a,a] => (:all_the_same, a)
           [a,bs...,c] => (:at_least_2, a, bs, c)
           Foo(x, "foo") where x > 1 => :foo
       end
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f("foo")
:string

julia> f([1,1,1])
(:all_the_same, 1)

julia> f([1,1])
(:at_least_2, 1, Int64[], 1)

julia> f([1,2,3,4])
(:at_least_2, 1, [2, 3], 4)

julia> f([1])

## Usage

### Assignment Syntax
``` julia
@match pattern = value
```

If value matches pattern, binds variables and returns `value`. Otherwise, throws `MatchFailure`.

After evaluation, any variable names used within `pattern` will be bound as new variables in the enclosing scope. For example:
```julia
julia> @match Foo(x,2) = Foo(1,2)
Foo(1,2)

julia> x
1
```

### Case Syntax

``` julia
@match value begin
    pattern1 => result1
    pattern2 => result2
    ...
end
```

Returns `result` for the first matching pattern. If there are no matching patterns, throws `MatchFailure`.

Note that unlike the _assignment syntax_, this does not create any variable bindings outside the match macro.

## Patterns

* `_` matches anything
* `foo` matches anything, binds value to `foo`
* `Foo(x,y,z)` matches structs of type `Foo` with fields matching `x,y,z`
* `Foo(y=1)` matches structs of type `Foo` whose `y` field equals `1`
* `[x,y,z]` matches `AbstractArray`s with 3 entries matching `x,y,z`
* `(x,y,z)` matches `Tuple`s with 3 entries matching `x,y,z`
* `[x,y...,z]` matches `AbstractArray`s with at least 2 entries, where `x` matches the first entry, `z` matches the last entry and `y` matches the remaining entries.
* `(x,y...,z)` matches `Tuple`s with at least 2 entries, where `x` matches the first entry, `z` matches the last entry and `y` matches the remaining entries.
* `_::T` matches any subtype (`isa`) of T
* `x || y` matches values which match either `x` or `y` (only variables which exist in both branches will be bound)
* `x && y` matches values which match both `x` and `y`
* `x where condition` matches only if `condition` is true (`condition` may use any variables that occur earlier in the pattern eg `(x, y, z where x + y > z)`)
* Anything else is treated as a constant and tested for equality
* Expressions can be interpolated in as constants via standard interpolation syntax `$(x)`

Patterns can be nested arbitrarily.

Repeated variables only match if they are equal (`==`). For example `(x,x)` matches `(1,1)` but not `(1,2)`.

## Differences from [Match.jl](https://github.com/kmsquire/Match.jl)

This package was branched from the original [Match.jl](https://github.com/kmsquire/Match.jl). It now differs in several ways:

* If no branches are matched, throws `MatchFailure` instead of returning nothing.
* Matching against a struct with the wrong number of fields produces an error instead of silently failing.
* Repeated variables require equality, ie `@match (1,2) begin (x,x) => :ok end` fails.
* The syntax for guards is `x where x > 1` instead of `x, if x > 1 end` and can occur anywhere in a pattern.
* Structs can be matched by field-names, allowing partial matches: `@match Foo(1,2) begin Foo(y=2) => :ok end` returns `:ok`.
* Patterns support interpolation, ie `let x=1; @match ($x,$(x+1)) = (1,2); end` is a match.
* No support (yet) for matching `Regex` or `UnitRange`.
* No support (yet) for matching against multidimensional arrays - all array patterns use linear indexing.
